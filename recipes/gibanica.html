        <h4>Gibanica (pronounced ghee-bun-eetsa) is a traditional, beloved Balkan pastry,<br>especially popular in Serbia, made from layers of phyllo dough, a rich mixture of cheese (like feta or sirene),<br>eggs, and often yogurt or sour cream, creating a savory pie that's crispy on the outside and juicy/creamy inside, served hot or cold for any occasion.</h4>

        <ol>

            <li>Prepare the Filling & Pan</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat Oven & Grease Pan: Set oven to 375-400°F (190-200°C) and generously butter or oil a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
                <li>Mix Filling: In a bowl, whisk eggs, then mix in crumbled feta, cottage cheese, a liquid (yogurt, milk, or sparkling water), oil, salt, and baking powder (if using).</li>
                <li>Prepare Brushing Liquid: Combine oil with a little water or sparkling water for brushing layers.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Layer the Dough & Filling</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Base Layers: Place 2-3 phyllo sheets flat in the pan, letting them overhang the sides. Brush with oil/water mix.</li>
                <li>Add Filling: Dollop or spread some cheese mixture over the phyllo. Drizzle with butter/oil.</li>
                <li>Crumple & Repeat: Take a phyllo sheet, crumple it loosely, dip it in the cheese mixture, squeeze out excess, and place it in the pan. Repeat until the filling is used, creating a puffy, layered texture.</li>
                <li>Top Layers: Place 2-3 final sheets on top, tucking in the edges, and brush generously with butter/oil or the egg/sour cream wash.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Bake & Serve</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake: Bake for 40-60 minutes until puffed, bubbly, and deep golden brown. (Cover with foil if browning too fast).</li>
                <li>Cool: Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
                <li>Serve: Enjoy warm, often with yogurt or kefir.</li>
            </ul>
