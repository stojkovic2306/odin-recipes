        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Filling</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sauté diced onions (and often garlic, bacon) in oil or lard until soft.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef, pork, and/or ham, breaking it up as it cooks.</li>
                <li>Stir in uncooked rice, seasonings (paprika, salt, pepper, Vegeta), and sometimes shredded carrots or potatoes.</li>
                <li>Mix well and let cool slightly.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Prepare the Cabbage Leaves</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use pickled cabbage leaves (from a jar) or steam fresh cabbage until pliable.</li>
                <li>Carefully separate leaves and remove the tough central rib without tearing the leaf.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Assemble the Rolls</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Place a portion of the filling near the base of a leaf.</li>
                <li>Fold the sides in, then roll it up tightly like a burrito from the base.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Layer in the Pot</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Line the bottom of a large pot with chopped sauerkraut, leftover cabbage ribs, or smoked meat.</li>
                <li>Arrange the sarma rolls tightly in layers, seam-side down.</li>
                <li>Add more smoked meat (like bacon) and bay leaves on top.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Cook & Finish</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour water or broth over the rolls to cover them.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2-3 hours until rice is cooked and flavors meld.</li>
                <li>Optional: Make a roux (flour, oil/lard, paprika) and stir into the cooking liquid for a richer sauce. </li>
            </ul>

        </ol>
